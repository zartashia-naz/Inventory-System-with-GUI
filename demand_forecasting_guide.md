# Demand Forecasting Guide

## Overview

The Demand Forecasting module in the Inventory Management System provides predictive analytics to help optimize inventory planning. By analyzing past 3 months of sales data, this feature helps in:

- Predicting future product demand
- Identifying sales patterns and trends
- Making data-driven restocking decisions
- Reducing stockouts and overstock situations

## Features

1. **Multiple Forecasting Models:**

   - **Exponential Smoothing**: Best for data with trends and seasonal patterns
   - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Powerful time series forecasting
   - **Moving Average**: Simple forecasting based on recent averages

2. **Customizable Forecast Period:**

   - 7 days (1 week)
   - 30 days (1 month)
   - 60 days (2 months)
   - 90 days (3 months)

3. **Comprehensive Visualizations:**

   - Historical sales with future predictions
   - Monthly sales patterns
   - Day-of-week sales patterns

4. **Forecast Metrics:**
   - Total expected demand
   - Average daily demand
   - Peak demand days

## How To Use

1. From the main dashboard, click the "Demand Forecast" button
2. Select a product from the dropdown menu
3. Choose your desired forecast period (7, 30, 60, or 90 days)
4. Select a forecasting model:
   - Exponential Smoothing (default, recommended for most cases)
   - ARIMA (for complex patterns)
   - Moving Average (for stable demand patterns)
5. Click "Generate Forecast" to view results

## Understanding The Results

The forecast results are displayed in three charts:

1. **Main Chart (Top):**

   - Blue line: Historical sales data from the past 3 months
   - Red dashed line: Forecasted demand for the selected period

2. **Monthly Pattern (Bottom Left):**

   - Bar chart showing monthly sales totals
   - Helps identify monthly trends or seasonality

3. **Weekly Pattern (Bottom Right):**

   - Bar chart showing average sales by day of week
   - Helps identify which days typically have higher or lower sales

4. **Summary Statistics (Bottom):**
   - Total expected demand for the forecast period
   - Average daily demand
   - Peak daily demand (maximum expected in a single day)

## Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Generate new forecasts weekly to maintain accuracy
- **Model Selection**:
  - Use Exponential Smoothing for seasonal products
  - Use ARIMA for products with complex patterns
  - Use Moving Average for stable, consistent products
- **Validation**: Compare previous forecasts with actual sales to evaluate model performance
- **Data Quality**: Ensure sales data is accurately recorded for best forecast results

## Technical Notes

- Forecasts are based on the previous 90 days of sales data
- All forecasts represent estimated demand, not guaranteed sales
- Forecasting accuracy improves with more historical data
- The system automatically accounts for zero-sales days in the calculations
